# Basics of indoor farming

It is totally possible to cultivate large amounts of crops indoors. 
Basically, all a plant needs to live are [5 things](https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdf/4H/4H36000.pdf):
1. Light
2. Nutritions
3. Air
4. Temperature
5. Water

Each of those are found in nature, enabling plants to florish in all sorts of ways. 
However, this is not optimal, because the parameters vary (strongly, from time to time).

Indoor farming is a way to control those parameters to increase crop yields and also makes the process more consistent, enabling year harvesting all year around.
